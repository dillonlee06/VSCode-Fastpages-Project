  <ul>
    <li>Use a development process to develop a program</li>
    <li>Design a program and its user interface</li>
    <li>A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature</li>
    <li>Common phases when developing a program: investigating and reflecting, designing, prototyping, testing</li>
    <li>Requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, and reflection: may require revisiting phases</li>
    <li>Break the project into smaller pieces and make sure each piece works before adding it to the whole</li>
    <li>Investigate to determine requirements, constraints, concerns and interests of customer</li>
    <li>Investigate by: collecting data through surveys, user testing, interviews, direct observations</li>
    <li>Requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program should provide</li>
    <li>Design phase that outlines how to accomplish a program’s goal may include: brainstorming, planning/storyboarding, organizing the program into modules and functional components, creation of diagrams, develop testing strategy</li>
    <li>Constantly test your program</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>When developing a program, it is important to cite and acknowledge code segments used from either another source or developed collaboratively</li>
    <li>When acknowledging someone else, include the origin of code or authors name in the program documentation</li>
    <li>Team of people usually work on a program by each focusing on different functional components</li>
    <li>Each member’s work should be credited in program documentation</li>
    <li>Sometimes credit is given with comments in the code</li>
    <li>Many developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms made by others who aren’t part of the project so it is important to credit them</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation</li>
    <li>Program documentation: a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed EX: comments (don’t effect how the program runs)</li>
    <li>Should actively document throughout development to help development as well as maintaining correct programs</li>
    <li>Program documentation created to: describe the program, list specifications, describe different parts of the program, list of contributors</li>
    <li>Document process: <strong>beginning:</strong> list specifications, <strong>during:</strong> keep track of progress, <strong>after:</strong> explain overall process</li>
    <li>Documentation improves: programming process efficiency, ability to test and refine program, responding to bugs</li>
    <li>How to comment:</li>
