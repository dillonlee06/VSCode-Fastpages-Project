<blockquote>
  <p>In 2-3 sentences, explain the purpose of DuckDNS as a DNS alternative to what is already in place (Freenom). Do you think we should use one or the other? Why or why not?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Answer: Users can link a domain name to an IP address using the free DNS service offered by DuckDNS. It can be used in place of Freenom, which also provides free domain names. When deciding, it is important to consider the different pros and cons regarding user friendliness, accessibility to domain extensions, customer service, etc</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sample Answer:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>DuckDNS provides a free dynamic DNS service that allows users to assign a domain name to a dynamic IP address. It can be used as an alternative to Freenom, which also offers free domain names. The choice between the two depends on individual needs and preferences, such as ease of use, availability of domain extensions, and customer support.</li>

<a class="anchor" href="#reflection-of-lesson" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reflection of Lesson</h2>
<p>The post outlines many DevOps hacks that developers and AP CSP students may find beneficial. The objective of DuckDNS, a free DNS service that enables users to assign a domain name to a dynamic IP address, is covered in the opening of the article. The importance of virtual desktops, such as KASM, in allowing users to use their PCs from any location with an internet connection is also covered in the article. The author contrasts LibreSSL with OpenSSL, two open-source SSL and TLS implementations, and talks about current OpenSSL security flaws. Additionally, the author offers FRQ techniques for EC2 AWS, such as checking for obsolete Nginx and Docker functionality and elucidating murky deployment instructions. The author then draws a diagram and describes the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing Duck.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#frq" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FRQ</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Complete the answers in your own words</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Question 1: How does AWS Work?</li>
    <li>AWS works by providing a cloud computing platform that allows users to access a wide range of infrastructure and application services on a pay-as-you-go basis. AWS operates on a global scale, providing high availability and scalability for its customers.</li>
    <li>Question 2: How is AWS useful for projects?</li>
    <li>AWS is useful for projects because it provides a wide range of infrastructure and application services that can be used to build, deploy, and scale applications quickly and easily. AWS also allows users to only pay for the services they use, making it cost-effective and scalable for projects of all sizes.</li>
    <li>Question 3: How does Duck DNS Work?</li>
    <li>Duck DNS works by providing a way to assign a domain name to a dynamic IP address. Users can create an account with Duck DNS, configure their router or device to update their IP address with Duck DNS, and then access their device using a domain name that points to their current IP address.</li>
    <li>Question 4: How is Duck DNS useful for projects?</li>
    <li>Duck DNS is useful for projects because it allows users to access their device using a domain name that points to their current IP address, even if the IP address changes frequently. This makes it easier to access the device remotely and also enables services to be hosted on devices with dynamic IP addresses.</li>
  </ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 3-4 sentences, please explain the significance of virtual desktops and KASM. How can virtual desktops such as these be utilized in our AP CSP environment? (0.45)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Users can access their PCs from any location with an internet connection by using virtual desktops like KASM. This is important because it enables users to access their documents and software without physically being in front of their computer, which is advantageous for both convenience and security. In an AP CSP setting, virtual desktops can be used to provide students with access to software and programming environments that they might not have on their personal devices and to establish a uniform and secure computing environment for all students.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Research and compare the security features of OpenSSL and LibreSSL, and write about the recent vulnerabilities within it. Write about your research in a fastpages blog post. It can be the same post that has your screenshot for the Certbot Hacks.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>OpenSSL and LibreSSL are open-source implementations of the SSL and TLS protocols used to encrypt data in transit over a network.</li>
    <li>LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL that was created after the discovery of several critical vulnerabilities in OpenSSL, which led to a major overhaul of the codebase to improve security.</li>
    <li>Recent vulnerabilities in OpenSSL have included Heartbleed, which allowed attackers to steal sensitive information from memory, and CVE-2021-3712, which allowed attackers to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.</li>

    <li>Are there any outdated Nginx/Docker functionalities to address?</li>
    <li>To make sure that the software used in a project is current and secure, it is always advised to check for the most recent versions of Nginx and Docker. By updating to the most recent version, any out-of-date features should be fixed.</li>
    <li>Is there anything unclear that we need to communicate further to the students for deployment?</li>

  <p>What are the pros and cons of using Duck DNS</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pros:</strong></li>
    <li>Duck DNS is free</li>
    <li>Can be integrated with various routers, services, and clients</li>
    <li>Supports multiple domains and subdomains</li>
    <li>Allows for the use of custom domain names</li>
    <li>Provides APIs for programmatic updates and management</li>
    <li>Offers HTTPS encryption and verification through Let’s Encrypt</li>
    <li><strong>Cons:</strong></li>
    <li>Supports multiple domains and subdomains</li>
    <li>Allows for the use of custom domain names</li>
    <li>Provides APIs for programmatic updates and management</li>
    <li>Offers HTTPS encryption and verification through Let’s Encrypt</li>
    <li>No availability or dependability guarantee; few customer support choices</li>
    <li>Limited customization choices compared to premium DNS services</li>
    <li>
      <ul>
        <li>DNS upgrades may take some time to propagate; may raise security issues if improperly protected and configured; may need periodic updates to retain domain ownership</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>HACK 2 - Write a reflection</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why do we use DNS?</li>
  <li>Human-readable domain names, like google.com, are converted into IP addresses via the Domain Name System (DNS), which is then used by computers to communicate with one another across the internet. Users can access websites and services more easily since they no longer need to remember complicated IP addresses.</li>
  <li>How does Duck DNS work?</li>
  <li>By giving users a domain name and a service to automatically change the IP address connected to that domain name, Duck DNS functions. Users that have dynamic IP addresses can use the service to generate a custom hostname that corresponds to their current IP address.</li>
  <li>What makes Duck DNS unique?</li>
  <li>Because it provides a free dynamic DNS service that enables customers to give a domain name to a device with a dynamic IP address that changes on a regular basis, Duck DNS is special. It is a well-liked option for small-scale and do-it-yourself projects because it is open source, easy to use, and compatible with numerous tools and services.</li>
  <li>How is Duck DNS useful for our projects?</li>
  <li>Duck DNS is useful for our projects as it provides a free and easy-to-use dynamic DNS service, which allows us to access our projects from anywhere with a static hostname. This eliminates the need for a static IP address and makes it easier to connect to our projects remotely.</li>
  <li>What are the steps to set up Duck DNS?</li>
  <li>You must register for a Duck DNS account, select a domain name, then download and set up the Duck DNS client on your device in order to set up Duck DNS. Following configuration, the client will routinely update the IP address linked to your domain name, making sure that your device may be accessed via the domain name.</li>
