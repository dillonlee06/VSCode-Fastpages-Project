  <ul>
    <li>It is important to know and be able to describe the purpose of a computing innovation</li>
    <li>The purpose could be to solve problems, pursue interests through creative expression, etc.</li>
    <li>Truly understanding the purpose of a program helps the developer(s) develop the program better</li>
    <li><img src="/VSCode-Fastpages-Project/images/innovations.png" alt="" title="Categories of innovation"></li>
    <li><strong>Essential Questions:</strong></li>
    <li>Why does the computing innovation exist?</li>
    <li>What problem(s) does the computing innovation solve?</li>
    <li>What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not do before?</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Identify inputs/outputs to a program</li>
    <li>Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Some forms can be: tactile, audio, visual, text</li>
    <li>An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program</li>
    <li>Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse clicked, etc. Can be any defined action that affects the flow of execution</li>
    <li>Inputs generally affect the output of a program</li>
    <li>In a program, the code is made in a way that after an action, the code “jumps” to the code segment according to the event</li>
    <li>Program’s output is based off input or prior state</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>A program (software) is a collection of program statements the performs a specific task when run by a computer.</li>
    <li>A code segment is a collection of program statements that is a part of a program</li>
    <li>Software needs to work for a variety of inputs</li>
    <li>The behavior is how the program functions during execution and if often described by how a user can interact with it.</li>
    <li>Can be described broadly by what it does or in detail on how the program accomplishes its function</li>
    <li>A program is a collection of statements: A statement is a single command, a group of statements is a code segment, code segments are executed -&gt; a program/software
