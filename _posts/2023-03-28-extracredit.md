# CSUSM Extra Credit Write Up

**Notes**

Failed in various courses in school but still went to Cal State and San Marcos 

Pathways: Computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, Mechanical engineer, robotics, STEM

A lot of people who go to CalState San Marcos, many people go through Mechanical Engineering

Mechanical Engineering is very Physics based

Cyber security club/robotics

It is important to be in clubs during your undergraduate years

Internships - some require knowledge in stuff like csp

Internships are also an important way to be a part of research and get into college

Google can be used to find so many different internship opportunities

When applying for Internships, 

The worst responds that you can get is that you are not qualified enough

Internships are also useful in determining your interests and exposing yourself to experiences

Scholarships can be found with many interests ANYTHING

You can get paid to pursue your interests. 

College Debt is a very real thing and also a really scary thing, it is important to take loans

There are two loans, an unsubsidized loan and a subsidized loan

A subsidized loan is a loan that is helped and provided to you by the government

An unsubsidized loan is a loan that is for undergraduate and graduate students that arenâ€™t based on financial aid


# **Summary**
Through this presentation, I learned much more about the California State University at San Marcos, such as its classes and departments. I learned about pathways I can take there and good opportunities given at CSUSM. I also learned about scholarships, grants, loans, internships, and more. I learned about advantages and downfalls of doing certain things and I gained advice about college applications. I also was able to narrow down my choice of college majors/pathway and what colleges I should apply to. At the end of class we did a small hands-on experience with electrical engineering, which was very interactive, and piqued my interest in the engineering field.
