# **Planning/Blogging findings**

**Design**
- Program Purpose and Function : A quiz that will ask questions relating to MLB, must show right/wrong and restart using Javascript code
- Data Abstraction: code uses variables such as the name of the button Ex: button 1 which when clicked, will for example, take the user to a new screen
- Managing Complexity: The code is just the same so it should be easy to just use the same lines of code over and over for the quiz.
- Procedural Abstraction: Organizing the code into the function blocks so it runs what we want to happen.
- Algorithm Implementation: Our algorithm of code will basically consist of "On Event" commands that are constantly looping that will take you to a new screen when the event of the button variable is clicked.
- Testing: Will test the code/design by hitting the run button and then testing to see if the code works

**Successes**
- Program Purpose and Function: The code made it function just the way we wanted it to function without too many difficulties.
- Data Abstraction: There were some instances where the variable got messed up in the code and some buttons didn't work but overall it was pretty easy to get these variables working.
- Managing Complexity: Was a longer process than it probrably could've been but it was still easy to manage the code.
- Procedural Abstraction: Since there were blocks, it was easy to just find the blocks I needed to code the quiz.
- Algorithm Implementation: while it was kinda boring creating the same "on event" code over and over with different variables, it was pretty easy to learn.
- Testing: normally got the code to work on the second try, after seeing what was wrong with it the first time

**Discoveries**
- Very long and tedious process where you have to just copy and paste the same code with just changing the variable.

**Challenges**
- Figuring out how to start the coding portion out. Right answer -> next question, restart button, etc.

**Plan**
> need to add pictures to make the quiz more entertaining
- correct/incorrect screen
- incorrect screen has retry button
- "take the quiz again" button at the end
