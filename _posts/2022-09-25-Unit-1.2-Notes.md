- It is important to know and be able to describe the purpose of a computing innovation
- The purpose could be to solve problems, pursue interests through creative expression, etc.
- Truly understanding the purpose of a program helps the developer(s) develop the program better
- ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/innovations.png "Categories of innovation")
- **Essential Questions:**
- Why does the computing innovation exist?
- What problem(s) does the computing innovation solve?

- Identify inputs/outputs to a program
- Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Some forms can be: tactile, audio, visual, text
- An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program
- Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse clicked, etc. Can be any defined action that affects the flow of execution
- Inputs generally affect the output of a program
- In a program, the code is made in a way that after an action, the code "jumps" to the code segment according to the event
- Program's output is based off input or prior state

- A program (software) is a collection of program statements the performs a specific task when run by a computer.

- Software needs to work for a variety of inputs
- The behavior is how the program functions during execution and if often described by how a user can interact with it.
- Can be described broadly by what it does or in detail on how the program accomplishes its function
- A program is a collection of statements: A statement is a single command, a group of statements is a code segment, code segments are executed -> a program/software
