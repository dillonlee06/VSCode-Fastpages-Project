| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| - | - | - | - |
| Row 1: Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | Video shows input and outputs and working, functioning program of rock paper scissors. Written response also explains the purpose and function well. |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | List of RPS is included but no segment for data abstraction where the list is called. |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity | 1 | 0 - Complexity isn't really managed as loop is simple yet not very good | Game's function is defined which includes a loop that shows a win, loss or draw |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Explanation for the importance of the procedure is not very informative nor relevant |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Written response provides a good explanation for the iteration and sequencing used for the program |
| Row 6: Testing | 1 | 1 | The first and second calls are shown with descriptions of each call's purpose as well as outputs |

| Row 1: Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | Good video showing the program's functionality and inputs/outputs. Written response also shows a good purpose as well as the input and output explained, aligning with what was shown in the video. |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | "letOfGuessWord" list is explained. Importance to program explained in the response as well as code shown that calls from the list. |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | For loop for the program is shown in the written response which meets all the requirements and does a good job at managing the difficult to code program. |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Requirements concerning the parameters and procedures are explained well in the response. |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Written response does a very good job explaining the algorithms and how they work to accomplish the program's function. |
| Row 6: Testing | 1 | 1 | Requirements for the first and second call conditions, inputs, and outputs in testing are met. |

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| - | - | - | - |
| Row 1: Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | Program purpose and functionality is shown in both the video and in the written response. |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction | 1 | 0 - no code is shown to use the list's data being used in the code and gives an inaccurate description. | “stateList” is explained regarding the role it plays in the program as well as code shown that calls that list. |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | Poor job "managing complexity" as the code for the function is unnecessarily long. |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 0 - missing a parameter | Student developed procedure is included with the necessary requirements. |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | Iteration is not included in the algorithm. |
| Row 6: Testing | 0 | 0 | The submission doesn't really explain why the tests are being run (the conditions being tested). |

| Row 1: Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | Functionality is shown in the video as well as the program's purpose and user inputs and outputs for the game. |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | List for the fish types is shown in the program as well as the purpose of the list and the list being used in the program. |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | List is shown being combined with a loop to manage the complexity. |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Explains functionality of the procedure with various parameters that help achieve the function's function. |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Explanation well written, explaining the algorithm with sequencing, selection, and iteration. |
| Row 6: Testing | 1 | 0 - results of the calls are not described in the submission | The first and second calls are shown with conditions as well as inputs/outputs |
