**Final Score 60/67**


# Q14:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/quiz614.png "14")


Correction: With this step, the algorithm will result in an infinite loop (unless number is a multiple of 10). For example, if the input is 512, the algorithm will display the remainder 2, then store 2 in number. The remainder of 2 divided by 10 is also 2, so 2 will be displayed and then stored in number again, and so on. If number is a multiple of 10, the algorithm will display 0 and then terminate.


# Q15:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/quiz615.png "15")


Correction: The answer is A because both programs print ten values.


# Q17:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/quiz617.png "17")


Correction: The answer is D because at the lowest level, all digital data (including machine language instructions) are represented with sequences of bits.


# Q32:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/quiz632.png "32")


Correction: The answer is D because this code segment subtracts the lowest score from the sum. It erroneously divides this result by the number of scores rather than one less than the number of scores.


# Q50:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/quiz650.png "50")


Correction: The answer is D because Algorithm I accesses elements 2n
times (twice for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm II accesses n2
elements (n times for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time.


# Q62:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/quiz662.png "62")


Correction: The answer is A and B rather than B and C because Since x OR y evaluates to true, the body of the IF statement is executed. Since x is true, true is displayed.


# Q67:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/quiz667.png "67")


Correction: For this code segment, count is increased to 1 the first time "maple" is encountered in the list. However, count is reset to 0 when the code segment moves to the next list element. This causes the procedure to return 0 instead of the intended result 1.
