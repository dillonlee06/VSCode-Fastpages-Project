**Final Score: 43/50**

# Q8:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/8.png "8")
Why I got it wrong and why the correct answer is right: The value of j does not need to be between 0 and k. The procedure only works if j and k are valid list indices, so it is important to document that j and k are both between 1 and LENGTH(numList), inclusive.

# Q14:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/14.png "14")
Why I got it wrong and why the correct answer is right: Correct. When numCorrect is 8, the condition numCorrect > 7 evaluates to true and the condition numCorrect â‰¥ 9 evaluates to false. Therefore "check minus" is displayed instead of the intended "check plus".

# Q34:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/34.png "34")
Why I got it wrong and why the correct answer is right: The code segment initially assigns an empty list to thirdList, but none of the lists are empty after the code segment is executed.

# Q35:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/35.png "35")
Why I got it wrong and why the correct answer is right: he last line in this code segment sets maxPS to 50 regardless of the value of time.

# Q36:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/36.png "36")
Why I got it wrong and why the correct answer is right: This would be the correct solution if i were initialized to 0 instead of 1. This code segment will generate the list [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22].

# Q39:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/39.png "39")
Why I got it wrong and why the correct answer is right: While the list elements are strings, the indices of a list are typically nonnegative integers.

# Q50:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/50.png "50")
Why I got it wrong and why the correct answer is right: This statement concatenates firstName and lastName and then assigns the first character of the result (which is the first character of firstName) to initials.
