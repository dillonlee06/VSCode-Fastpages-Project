Correction: The answer is C because In order to determine whether students who play a sport are more or less likely to have higher grade point averages than students who do not play any sports, we need to compare the grade point averages of students who play sports to the grade point averages of students who do not play sports. Spreadsheet I contains the grade point averages for all students at the school. Spreadsheet II contains the sports played by students. By combining these spreadsheets, we can identify which students play sports and their corresponding grade point averages.
