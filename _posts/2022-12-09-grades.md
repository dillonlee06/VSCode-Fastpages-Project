# Unit 3 Sections 1-2 (Our group)
We got a 2.4/3 on our grading because we were too lenient and also didn't put a reason for why we gave the grades we gave.

# Unit 3 Sections 3-4

# Unit 3 Sections 5-7
I got a 0.9/1 on this group's hw. Their reason was "They got his grade since they fully completed the homework assignment using their own code." I think that I got this grade because I did research on the internet to complete their hw and also used notes from last tri to add something a little extra.

# Unit 3 Sections 8 and 10
I got a 0.9/1 on this group's hw/ Their reason was "Thorough notes. Challenges are fully complete. Good reflection on challenges. Quiz is fully complete with no hacks." I can agree with the fact that I blogged my mistakes and I definately don't deserve higher than a 0.9 because I didn't do any hacks and my quiz was also a little scuffed.
