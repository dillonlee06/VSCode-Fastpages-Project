# Submission 1

| Row 1: Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 1 | Video shows the program working flawlessly as well as the written response explaining all the necessary things. But, the problem being solved nor the interest is included.|
| Row 2: Data Abstraction | 1 | 0 | The list includes multiple classifications for the type of triangle which helps fulfill the program focus |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | I don't think that list actually is used in the program as the video doesn't show any data abstraction from that list |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | 3.c.i. and 3.c.ii. Shows a procedure with parameter as well as that procedure getting called. |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | all the requirements of an algorithm are included in the written response |
| Row 6: Testing | 1 | 1 | The written response includes first and second call as well as the conditions tested for each |
