# Dopamine Issues Reflection
In our modern world, dopamine issues refer to our addiction and need for technology, specifically in things like social media, entertainment, games, etc. These technological issues pose great threats to those who need to be productive rather than preoccupied. Social media and gaming can also cause problems that relate to cyber bullying, leading to stress and anxiety.

# **5.2**

> How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
- Empowering one's self in the digital world can just be making enough money and being in a place where technology is available and affordable for someone.

> How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
- One thing that Del Norte High School provides, is the ability to access a free school chromebook, therefore allowing a student to "empower" themselves by gaining easy access to technology, therefore allowing them to compete with the rest of those in the digital world.

> Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
- Barriers that can block digital empowerment include restrictions such as money (cannot afford technology) or location (not technologically advanced enough such as a third world country).
