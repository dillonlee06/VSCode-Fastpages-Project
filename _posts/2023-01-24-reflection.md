# **5.1**

# Our Project (Electric Cars)

> Beneficial
- Gives valuable and accurate information on the cars as well as facts
- Provides services which can help someone decide on their car situations
- Extra features that could entertain while still informing and comfortabalizing users relating to cars

> Harmful
- May not always be up to date
- Does not cover all electric cars, just the brands that are full electric
- Doesn't compare with other options

# Google

> Beneficial
- Can easily access resources and information
- Quick and convenient search engine
- There is information which covers basically any topic which can help anyone utilizing this resource

> Harmful
- Anybody can add anything on a website which can be accessed
- Can lead you to corrupt sources which can harm your computing source
- Information can be misleading

# FIFA 23

> Beneficial
- Entertaining, easy to have fun playing
- Way to play/do something with friends
- Become more cultured in terms of soccer (football)

> Harmful
- Can be addictive (dopamine issues)
- Takes up a lot of time
- Takes up a lot of space on a computing platform

# Dopamine Issues Reflection
In our modern world, dopamine issues refer to our addiction and need for technology, specifically in things like social media, entertainment, games, etc. These technological issues pose great threats to those who need to be productive rather than preoccupied. Social media and gaming can also cause problems that relate to cyber bullying, leading to stress and anxiety.

# **5.2**

> How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
- Empowering one's self in the digital world can just be making enough money and being in a place where technology is available and affordable for someone.

> How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
- One thing that Del Norte High School provides, is the ability to access a free school chromebook, therefore allowing a student to "empower" themselves by gaining easy access to technology, therefore allowing them to compete with the rest of those in the digital world.

> Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
- Barriers that can block digital empowerment include restrictions such as money (cannot afford technology) or location (not technologically advanced enough such as a third world country).

# **5.3**

> Intentional or Purposeful Bias
- Facebook is obviously more used by the older generations while other social media apps such as TikTok or Instagram are more used by the younger generation
- I don't think that the producers of the apps and programs intended for this age gap, but I think that they have to work with what they have
- This is why the bias exists between these platforms since the companies would make more money through advertising something that would be appealing to their user base (Facebook ads for the older generation, TikTok ads for the younger generation)
- The other "intentional bias" we discussed regarded the voices of Siri, Alexa, etc.
- This bias I think is obviously intentional regarding the female voices as the female voice is seen by many as likely more soothing and less threatening or aggressive
- Therefore, companies would likely choose the female over the male voice to make their products more appealing to users and therefore make more money
- Algorithms that influence decisions such as suggested searches used by programs would also show the use of intentional bias to try and skew the user's attention and suggestions to be something that would benefit the company

> Racist Computers
- In the video, the owner of the computer thinks that the company was actually racist and bias when developing the software for the camera since the camera doesn't follow him but does follow his coworker who has white skin
- I think this is merely an unintentional result of the producers not doing enough testing or coding for the database regarding the camera's sensitivity to different skin colors
- This is obviously a harmful product but could be easily fixed through more testing and experimentation so that is more accessible and usable for a wider range of the population
- One thing that could be done to easily collect more data (skin colors) is to utilize crowdsourcing

> Final thoughts:
- I feel like the bias we learned about today, specifically in computing, is generally unintentional by developers since there are always factors that couldn't be considered. For example, the racist camera was just a result of probably not enough experimentation/crowdsourcing or simply just a choice to get as little criticism as possible from the users. There is also the fact that they need to make as much money from the users that they get which they can't exactly control.

# **5.4**

> Crowdsourcing
- Crowdsourcing is when data is obtained for a purpose through the use of various methods, some may be harmless, some may be harmful
- One crowdsourcing idea that our group implemented into our project regarded the log in page
- Our log-in page implemented not only the username and password, but what car they currently drive which is collecting data regarding the users that use our platform
- We also have a like dislike page for users which collects data on users' favorite cars which then travels to a database which can be used to add appealing aspects to out website for the users
- At N@TM, I am thinking of maybe using surveys to crowdsource information for anyone who interacts with my project and then use that data from the survey to conduct a conclusion which can be a form of testing for the program, allowing me to correct or improve on anything that wasn't up to par (based on the survey results)
