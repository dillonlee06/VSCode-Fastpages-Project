**Any sociology questions within team need to be answered with a Blog, A Scrum Master working with other Developers should establish the Github administration/sociology policies:**

> What is the main repository for your project?
- [Group Repository](https://github.com/dillonlee06/GroupRepository)

> Did you create a .gitignore to avoid committing files that ‘don’t belong in version control?
- [gitignore](https://github.com/dillonlee06/GroupRepository/blob/main/.gitignore)

> Do you have a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies introduced to your Code Base?
- [Requirements for project](https://github.com/dillonlee06/GroupRepository#readme)

> Have you established Issues as part of your Development process? 
- [Group Issue (to do's)](https://github.com/dillonlee06/GroupRepository/issues/1)

> Have you considered making Pull Requests to track development? 
> Have you considered forks or branching techniques with pull requests? 
- [Pull Request](https://github.com/dillonlee06/GroupRepository/compare/main%40%7B1day%7D...main)
- I created this pull request in the group repository so my group knows that I updated our repository and they should pull before working on it

> Are you managing Issues on a Project Board/Scrum Board like Kanban?
- [Group Scrum Board](https://github.com/users/dillonlee06/projects/2)
