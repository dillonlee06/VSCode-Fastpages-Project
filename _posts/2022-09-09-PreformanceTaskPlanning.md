# plan for performance task
> Rohan and I will:
- Share a common code and deviate based on whatever theme or idea we want to do
- Create a Jupyter notebook where we can make a database to store information
- make a search engine that will extract information from the database
- Variables: we can use this to interchange the variables in between 2 code cells
- one code cell stores data, and the other code cell outputs the data
- we can classify and sort each input in the database (e.g. date of birth, height, other stats)
- We might split this task into smaller problems and we will specify who wrote which code cells
- we can take inspiration from Data Abstraction week to help us complete the task
