# Submission 1


| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| - | - | - | - |
| Row 1: Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | Video shows working program but the written response concerning the purpose is not very good. |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The list is not well explained involving the importance and relevance in the program. |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity | 1 | 0 no code segments that are used to manage a list | Requirements are met regarding the code managing complexity with a simple explanation. |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | don't see a procedure nor a procedure being called |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 0 explanations not good | use of a loop with sequencing is shown with a short explanation |
| Row 6: Testing | 1 | 1 | The first and second calls are shown with descriptions of each call's purpose as well as outputs |


# Submission 2


| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| - | - | - | - |
| Row 1: Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The submission includes a good video showing the function with a good description for both input and output. |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Shows two different code segments that show a function calling a list. |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | Person uses the lists and a function to randomize the words and the person does a good job describing it. |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The submission uses randomization for their purpose and has detailed explanations. |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Submission has a procedure that includes iteration, selection, and sequencing and written thorough descriptions. |
| Row 6: Testing | 1 | 1 | Meets all the criteria with the two calls and outputs |

# Submission 3


| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| - | - | - | - |
| Row 1: Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 not all criteria met | Video, although not of the best quality, shows the working program and the written response explains the purpose, functionality, and the input and output aligning with the video |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction | 0 | 1 Explanation of list is very descriptive | Explains what list is used but doesn't show the list anywhere |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The submission includes a list in order to meet criteria and defines complex functions. |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Shows the use of a procedure and the procedure being called which follows the purpose, includes parameters. |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Uses a procedure that includes iteration and selection within the code and explanations for them. |
| Row 6: Testing | 1 | 1 | Meets all the criteria with the two calls and outputs |

# Submission 4


| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| - | - | - | - |
| Row 1: Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | Video shows the working program and the written response explains the purpose, functionality, and the input and output aligning with the video |
| Row 2: Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | I don't see a list anywhere in the written submission |
| Row 3: Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | No list in the program therefore no way to use a function that will use that list |
| Row 4: Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Shows the use of a procedure with a parameter and the procedure being called. |
| Row 5: Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | A;l the requirements of an algorithm are included in the written response with iteration and selection, and thoroughly describes the purpose and how it functions. |
| Row 6: Testing | 0 | 0 | Use of testing is poor in the written response |
