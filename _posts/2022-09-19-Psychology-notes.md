**Blog a note of gratitude to someone on campus and someone at home, record your experience in GH Pages.**
- Someone on campus:
> I'm grateful to Mr. Yeung for giving me a 2.9 on last weeks Creative Development presentation. I'm also grateful that he helped me install and run Docker/a live changes website.
- Someone at home: 
> I'm grateful that my mom signed me up and drove me to the DMV so that I could take the driving test and get my drivers license.
