# Notes

- 60% of students have excessive amounts of anxiety.

> Our thoughts
- My thoughts: I found it very surprising how much anxiety and stress the average college student has during their time spent in an academic environment. It makes me worry about myself and how college life will be like. I also reflect and think about how much correlation it has with high school stress at Del Norte. 
- Derek's thoughts: He found it interesting that in the video, they explain how everyone deals with stress and it isn't something that is easy to deal with. One thing that struck him was that 40% of the students from Laurie Santos' class in Yale said they feel helpless. This struck him  because it puts into perspective how many people deal with some sort of unhappiness and that we are not alone.
- Rohan's thoughts: Found that the video was relatable, she mentioned good strategies to reduce stress. The statistics were also very alarming to him. He also thinks that stress hinderes the ability to learn which is why it should be prevented as much as possible.
- Saavan's thoughts: He thought it was good to know the things we need to do to relieve stress. He believes it is very important in working towards living a happier life and it isn't as easy as it sounds.

- Someone on campus:

- Someone at home: 
> I'm grateful that my mom signed me up and drove me to the DMV so that I could take the driving test and get my drivers license.
