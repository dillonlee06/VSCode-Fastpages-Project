- Describe: This piece of artwork is a painting of a split up face connected by a thin wire-like structure. 
- Analyze: The split up, different parts of a face could represent different parts of a personality. Missing parts of the face could represent missing parts of a personality. The thing wires holding it together in designated places, represents how we show our personality to the outside world in the way we want to be seen.
- Interpret: I think that it would be cool to see this piece of artwork on a 3-D model rather than a 2-D painting.
- Evaluate: I chose this picture because I found this particular painting visually appealing and abstract. Yt uses various different forms of artwork styles such as blending, texturing, and value. I also saw through the art and into the deeper meaning that I could analyze in this blog post.
