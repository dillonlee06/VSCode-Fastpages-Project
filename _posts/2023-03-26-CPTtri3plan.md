**Plans to Finish CPT**

> Things I want to improve on/fix from last trimester's final:
- Improve aesthetic of the blog page for Lucid
- Add formatting ( < style> ) for the table that had my CRUD
- Improve the "parking lot" style to make it look more obvious that it is a parking lot
- Add Delete part of CRUD to API if it's necessary for CPT/class requirements

> EOY Project
- EOY teams were just created this week with the EOY Project being assigned as well
- Our 8 person group must complete Big Idea 1: Developing Frontend/Backend Application and Big Idea 2 A Guide to Binary Math, truth tables and logic (some code and hacks to be provided)
- We should work to complete it in a timely manner so that everyone can start on their CPT project improvements after we finish
