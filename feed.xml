While my project was not as extravagant as I originally intended, I am very proud of what I have to show for my overall CSP improvement over the last trimester. At the event, my part of the website did end up breaking in the part with the table including the charging times as the loop that I created to reveal all the charging times at once was not functioning correctly so that when I hit the button to reveal all the elements in the table at once. I also wanted to add some more formatting to that page with the charging time information to make it look better and more professional as well as for the main page with the Lucid information. Similarly, I wanted to make the grid in the game look more like a parking lot but was not able to get that done before the deadline. My Night at the Museum Experience During Night at the Museum this trimester, I mainly wondered around the two rooms used for CSP and CSA projects to see what other people did and compare it with ours. I also looked at other artwork (paintings) in the room next to the CSP room that looked like it was from one of those art classes. I was most intrigued by the projects in the Computer Animation room since I took that class and really enjoyed it last school year. In this classroom, I took pictures of their projects which I will be analyzing and critiquing. Artwork 1]]></summary></entry></feed>
