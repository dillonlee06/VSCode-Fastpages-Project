What problem(s) does the computing innovation solve? What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not do before?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">JavaScript Notebook</title><link href="https://dillonlee06.github.io/VSCode-Fastpages-Project/csp%20notes/week%206/2022/09/25/JavaScriptNotebook.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="JavaScript Notebook" /><published>2022-09-25T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://dillonlee06.github.io/VSCode-Fastpages-Project/csp%20notes/week%206/2022/09/25/JavaScriptNotebook</id><author><name>Dillon Lee</name></author><category term="CSP Notes" /><category term="Week 6" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">JavaScript Fragments</title><link href="https://dillonlee06.github.io/VSCode-Fastpages-Project/csp%20assignments/week%206/2022/09/25/HTMLFragments.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="JavaScript Fragments" /><published>2022-09-25T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://dillonlee06.github.io/VSCode-Fastpages-Project/csp%20assignments/week%206/2022/09/25/HTMLFragments</id><author><name></name></author><category term="CSP Assignments" /><category term="Week 6" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our Group]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Unit 1.1 - Collaboration Notes</title><link href="https://dillonlee06.github.io/VSCode-Fastpages-Project/csp%20notes/week%205/2022/09/19/Unit-1.1-Notes.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Unit 1.1 - Collaboration Notes" /><published>2022-09-19T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://dillonlee06.github.io/VSCode-Fastpages-Project/csp%20notes/week%205/2022/09/19/Unit-1.1-Notes</id><author><name></name></author><category term="CSP Notes" /><category term="Week 5" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unit 1.1 Notes on Collaboration Daily Video 1 Innovations are improved through collaboration in CSP A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function Effective collaboration skills: Communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, negotiation Computing innovation: reflects the diversity of talents and unique perspectives of all the programers who worked to create it Collaboration on projects can reduce bias since there are various perspectives Video Quiz: Daily Video 2 How computing innovations are developed by groups of people Consultation and communication between peers is important Information contributed from all the group members can help understand the purpose of the program and create one that incorporates all the perspectives Online tools can help collaboration such as pair programming Pair programming: work together in pairs- the driver writes the code, the navigator reviews it Think pair share: students work through a problem alone then pair with a partner then share with class It is important to give credit Quiz 2/3]]></summary></entry></feed>
