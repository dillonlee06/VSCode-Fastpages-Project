It is important to know and be able to describe the purpose of a computing innovation | The purpose could be to solve problems, pursue interests through creative expression, etc. | Truly understanding the purpose of a program helps the developer(s) develop the program better | | Essential Questions: | Why does the computing innovation exist? | What problem(s) does the computing innovation solve? | What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not do before? | . Daily Video 2 . Identify inputs/outputs to a program | Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Some forms can be: tactile, audio, visual, text | An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program | Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse clicked, etc. Can be any defined action that affects the flow of execution | Inputs generally affect the output of a program | In a program, the code is made in a way that after an action, the code “jumps” to the code segment according to the event | Program’s output is based off input or prior state | Daily Video 3 | A program (software) is a collection of program statements the performs a specific task when run by a computer. | A code segment is a collection of program statements that is a part of a program | Software needs to work for a variety of inputs | The behavior is how the program functions during execution and if often described by how a user can interact with it. | Can be described broadly by what it does or in detail on how the program accomplishes its function | A program is a collection of statements: A statement is a single command, a group of statements is a code segment, code segments are executed -&gt; a program/software Quiz . 5/6 . | .",

Our thoughts . My thoughts: I found it very surprising how much anxiety and stress the average college student has during their time spent in an academic environment. It makes me worry about myself and how college life will be like. I also reflect and think about how much correlation it has with high school stress at Del Norte. | Derek’s thoughts: He found it interesting that in the video, they explain how everyone deals with stress and it isn’t something that is easy to deal with. One thing that struck him was that 40% of the students from Laurie Santos’ class in Yale said they feel helpless. This struck him because it puts into perspective how many people deal with some sort of unhappiness and that we are not alone. | Rohan’s thoughts: Found that the video was relatable, she mentioned good strategies to reduce stress. The statistics were also very alarming to him. He also thinks that stress hinderes the ability to learn which is why it should be prevented as much as possible. | Saavan’s thoughts: He thought it was good to know the things we need to do to relieve stress. He believes it is very important in working towards living a happier life and it isn’t as easy as it sounds. | .

Program Purpose and Function : A quiz that will ask questions relating to MLB, must show right/wrong and restart using Javascript code | Data Abstraction: code uses variables such as the name of the button Ex: button 1 which when clicked, will for example, take the user to a new screen | Managing Complexity: The code is just the same so it should be easy to just use the same lines of code over and over for the quiz. | Procedural Abstraction: Organizing the code into the function blocks so it runs what we want to happen. | Algorithm Implementation: Our algorithm of code will basically consist of “On Event” commands that are constantly looping that will take you to a new screen when the event of the button variable is clicked. | Testing: Will test the code/design by hitting the run button and then testing to see if the code works | . Successes . Program Purpose and Function: The code made it function just the way we wanted it to function without too many difficulties. | Data Abstraction: There were some instances where the variable got messed up in the code and some buttons didn’t work but overall it was pretty easy to get these variables working. | Managing Complexity: Was a longer process than it probrably could’ve been but it was still easy to manage the code. | Procedural Abstraction: Since there were blocks, it was easy to just find the blocks I needed to code the quiz. | Algorithm Implementation: while it was kinda boring creating the same “on event” code over and over with different variables, it was pretty easy to learn. | Testing: normally got the code to work on the second try, after seeing what was wrong with it the first time | .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
