<p>For Night at the Museum, we were not able to create the website we hoped to create as there were many errors that came with the APIs as well as the intended drop down menu. For next year’s Night at the Museum, I will be sure to implement more error testing and project design as well as putting more time overall into the project.</p>

<p>During Night at the Museum, I looked at projects from CSP, 3D Animation, but mainly Studio Art (which is where I got these pictures from) since I was most interested in their pictures.</p>
<h1 id="painting-1">
<a class="anchor" href="#painting-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Painting 1</h1>
<p><img src="/VSCode-Fastpages-Project/images/natm1.png" alt="" title="Picture 1"></p>
<ul>
  <li>Evaluate (Why I picked the picture): I chose this picture because I found this particular painting visually appealing and abstract. It uses various different forms of artwork styles such as blending, texturing, and value. I also saw through the art and into the deeper meaning that I could analyze in this blog post.</li>
  <li>Describe (How it looks ): This piece of artwork is a painting of a split up face connected by a thin wire-like structure.</li>
  <li>Analyze (Deeper meaning?): The split up, different parts of a face could represent different parts of a personality. Missing parts of the face could represent missing parts of a personality. The thing wires holding it together in designated places, represents how we show our personality to the outside world in the way we want to be seen.</li>
  <li>Post-Analysis Thoughts: I think that it would be cool to see this piece of artwork on a 3-D model rather than a 2-D painting.
    <h1 id="painting-2">
<a class="anchor" href="#painting-2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Painting 2</h1>
    <p><img src="/VSCode-Fastpages-Project/images/natm2.png" alt="" title="Picture 2"></p>
  </li>
  <li>Evaluate (Why I picked the picture): I chose this picture because the details on it made it look so realistic and quite literally a masterpiece. The girl in the photo looks like she is basically on a 3D platform and the fish in the mirror is detailed to look like it is a real fish.</li>
  <li>Describe (How it looks): The picture is of a girl standing in front of a very large, detailed mirror with a fish inside it surrounded by water.</li>
  <li>Analyze (Deeper meaning?): I can’t really derive a deeper meaning around it but it seems obviously, like she is comparing herself to that of a fish in a way but I can’t see why.</li>
  <li>Post-Analysis Thoughts: I think this artist did very well with this piece of art, specifically on the marble floor with the reflection that looked very realistic in the painting. I would really like to know what the deeper meaning could be, maybe through some form of personalization of the girl.</li>
