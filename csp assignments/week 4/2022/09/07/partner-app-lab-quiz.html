<p><strong>Design</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Program Purpose and Function : A quiz that will ask questions relating to MLB, must show right/wrong and restart using Javascript code</li>
  <li>Data Abstraction: code uses variables such as the name of the button Ex: button 1 which when clicked, will for example, take the user to a new screen</li>
  <li>Managing Complexity: The code is just the same so it should be easy to just use the same lines of code over and over for the quiz.</li>
  <li>Procedural Abstraction: Organizing the code into the function blocks so it runs what we want to happen.</li>
  <li>Algorithm Implementation: Our algorithm of code will basically consist of “On Event” commands that are constantly looping that will take you to a new screen when the event of the button variable is clicked.</li>
  <li>Testing: Will test the code/design by hitting the run button and then testing to see if the code works</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Successes</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Program Purpose and Function: The code made it function just the way we wanted it to function without too many difficulties.</li>
  <li>Data Abstraction: There were some instances where the variable got messed up in the code and some buttons didn’t work but overall it was pretty easy to get these variables working.</li>
  <li>Managing Complexity: Was a longer process than it probrably could’ve been but it was still easy to manage the code.</li>
  <li>Procedural Abstraction: Since there were blocks, it was easy to just find the blocks I needed to code the quiz.</li>
  <li>Algorithm Implementation: while it was kinda boring creating the same “on event” code over and over with different variables, it was pretty easy to learn.</li>
  <li>Testing: normally got the code to work on the second try, after seeing what was wrong with it the first time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Discoveries</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Very long and tedious process where you have to just copy and paste the same code with just changing the variable.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Figuring out how to start the coding portion out. Right answer -&gt; next question, restart button, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Plan</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>need to add pictures to make the quiz more entertaining</p>
  <ul>
    <li>correct/incorrect screen</li>
    <li>incorrect screen has retry button</li>
    <li>“take the quiz again” button at the end</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
