</ul><h1 id="overview">
<a class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h1>
<p>My individual portion of the final project will include a game where the user will be able to move a car onto a specific parking spot with a charger for the electric car. The user will then guess how long it will take for it to charge which depending on how close they were, will be given a score. There will also be buttons that reveal information on electric cars and charging.</p>

<h1 id="row-1-program-purpose-and-function">
<a class="anchor" href="#row-1-program-purpose-and-function" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Row 1 Program Purpose and Function</h1>
<p>The user input will be dragging the car into a designated space and then typing in an integral value to predict how long the car will take to charge. The output will be the actual time the car took to charge as well as a score that is given to the user. This will help familiarize the users with the electric car charging process and inform them on the benefits of certain cars (charging speeds and such).</p>

<h1 id="row-2-data-abstraction">
<a class="anchor" href="#row-2-data-abstraction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Row 2 Data Abstraction</h1>
<p>I will include a list of the different cars that will be included in the game which are all assigned different charging speeds. This list will be called towards the beginning of the program to decide which car will be controlled by the user.</p>

<h1 id="row-3-managing-complexity">
<a class="anchor" href="#row-3-managing-complexity" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Row 3 Managing Complexity</h1>
<p>Will use a loop of some sorts that also utilizes a list in order to manage the complexity in my program.</p>

<h1 id="row-4-procedural-abstraction">
<a class="anchor" href="#row-4-procedural-abstraction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Row 4 Procedural Abstraction</h1>
<p>Parameters will be used in the math functions that will be included in this program as I will have to come up with certain functions that determine the charging procedure of the car.</p>

<h1 id="row-5-algorithm-implementation">
<a class="anchor" href="#row-5-algorithm-implementation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Row 5 Algorithm Implementation</h1>
<p>I will use an algorithmic loop (iteration) to repeat certain functions in the program which will include parameters as well as sequencing and selection.</p>

<h1 id="row-6-testing">
<a class="anchor" href="#row-6-testing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Row 6 Testing</h1>
<p>Testing should be pretty easy as later in the process, I will obviously test for different conditions such as dragging the car into the wrong spot or not typing in a value.</p>
