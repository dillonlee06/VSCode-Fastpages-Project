If the user's answer is correct, the quiz prints \"Correct\" and increments the score by 1. If the user's answer is incorrect, the quiz prints \"Incorrect\" and shows the correct answer. At the end of the quiz, the score is displayed to the user. The code begins by printing a welcome message and setting the number of quiz questions to 5. Then, it defines two lists: quiz_questions and quiz_answers. The quiz_questions list contains the five quiz questions as strings, and the quiz_answers list contains the correct answers for each question. Next, the code initializes the score variable to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the user's score as they answer the quiz questions. The main part of the code is a for loop that iterates over the quiz questions and answers. For each question, the quiz prints the question and the four possible answer choices. The user is prompted to enter their answer, and the code checks whether it is correct by comparing it to the correct answer in the quiz_answers list. If the user's answer is correct, the score is incremented by 1 and the quiz prints \"Correct\". If the user's answer is incorrect, the quiz prints \"Incorrect\" and shows the correct answer."
