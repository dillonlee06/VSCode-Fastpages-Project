    "__ Packages __ allow a python user to import __ methods __ from a __ Library __, and use the methods in their code.

    "Sometimes we only need to import a single __ method __ from the package. We can do that with the word __ \"from:\" __ , followed by the package name, then the word __ \"import\" __ , then the method. This will allow you to use the method without mentioning the package's name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used.
