    "Okay, so we've learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there's a more advanced program you don't know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. \n",
    "\n",
    "You've already learned about __ functions __ that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? \n",
    "\n",
    "__ Packages __ allow a python user to import __ methods __ from a __ Library __, and use the methods in their code. Most libraries come with __ documentation __ on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick __ google search __. methods are used with the following: \n",

    "Some libraries are always installed, such as those with the __ list __ methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called __ import __. We will learn different ways to __ import __ in Challenge 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we only need to import a single __ method __ from the package. We can do that with the word __ \"from:\" __ , followed by the package name, then the word __ \"import\" __ , then the method. This will allow you to use the method without mentioning the package's name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use __ \"*\" __.\n",
